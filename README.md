# utilities

## SECOORA/IOOS "utilities.py" as a separate module.

The project goals is to make it easier for people to understand what is in
the several `utilities.py`.  IOOS/system-test `utilities.py` re-implemented
these functions several times in different directories, causing function
code fragmentation and making it hard to fix all functions if a bug is found.
